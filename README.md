# dot.emacs.zook

An .emacs.d configuration. Mainly for Clojure and Javascript development.

An incomplete list of features:
- undo-tree.
- clojure-mode.
- paredit.
- pretty rainbow parens.
- cider (for Clojure).
- clj-refactor.
- web-mode (for React JSX editing, amongst other things).
- cyberpunk-theme.
- M-y for browe-kill-ring.
- tango-dark theme by default.
- no menu bar.
- sync with OSX clipboard.
- Two finger scrolling on OSX.
- "C-x C-b" for ibuffer.
- ido-mode.
- M-/ for hippie expand (auto-complete from text on the page).
- Search forward (C-s) and back (C-r) are regexp by default (C-M-s and C-M-r without).
- Go back to previous edit location when reopening a file.
- Copy whole line with "C-c C-k".

Useful shortcuts:
- C-x h: mark whole buffer.
- M-^: join line with one above.
- C-x <RIGHT> / C-x <LEFT>: switch to next / previous buffer.
